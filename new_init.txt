use the embeddings to train a simple classifier to see if we can get anything interesting out of it. 

focus only on DINO as the output embeddings is of the nice size. 
use nromalisation because it makes sense. 

then do maybe a comparison between rgb and gray for the mosaic. only one set of comparison. not 48. 

we want to see if the features are good, which they seem to be, and see how useful they are. 
also choose appropriate metrics for analysing the results, considering the imnalance

we like explainable stuff. 
figure out decision tree or something similar.
