This repository contains the scripts and files for the research project for KDS 3rd semester. 

The folders should be names with informative names. specifically:
- Scripts contains all the python files used for the analysis and results of the project
- embeddings files both normalised and not are in the relevant folders.
- analysis of embeddings distance contains the results of the embeddings median analysis of the dataset.

 The data is proprietary, so I cannot share it publically, but the relevant examples are shown in the paper. 

 The code was generated with different LLMs when needed, to speed up the process, in accordance with ITU guidelines on usage of Generative AI.
